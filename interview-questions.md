# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: A git is the data and what it is contained in. Github is a place or cloud for the data to be stored making it easier to be shared and managed.

Researched answer: Git is a free open-sourced version control system widely used in the programming world. It allows people to contribute to the same code. It was created to track changes in code. GitHub is the hosting platform for the Git. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Booleans are true or false statements. Logical operators && (and) and || (or) will return a boolean value. 

Researched answer: Equality operators compare one value to the other and judge if the values equate to the same thing. If they do equate to the same a Boolean value of true is returned if not we get a Boolean value of false.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an arrays index starts the count at zero and includes spaces. The value is a count of the characters itself.

Researched answer: The value in an array is an elemement. The content of the element is the value. The index is the location of the value. The index of each value is like an address for the value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: While both arrays and strings are peices of data, strings are more of a statement and arrays are more of a vessel in which to store data.

Researched answer: In JavaScript, arrays and strings have a lot of similar properties. They both are a collection of items, both have a length property, both are zero-indexed. But strings and arrays have many differences. It is often convenient to convert string into arrays and vice-versa.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is a system in which two or more programmers work together on a project. Programming is such a detail oriented task that it is often useful to have another set of eyes and brains to work through tasks and challenges. There will be a Navigator and a Driver. The Navigator guides the Driver by passing the information that will be taken down into code while the driver enters in the data. The participants will switch roles allowing all participants a chance to drive and navigate.

Researched answer: Two people collaborating on one code source to collectively produce one program.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-order functions are built in methods in JavaScript. They are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument.  The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It is an excellent way to show future employers that you care about your code and know what you are doing.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.

4. Method: Objects can also contain functions. When a function belongs to an object it is called a method.

5. Classes: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects.
