# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is an application that works locally through an operating system, it allows users to make code and have it work with other applications, such as text editors to do so. 
Github is a global platform, which allows people to share commits of their code and work on it together, even work on it open source. Users make accounts and repositories and can update their own information in their own about me section/pictures to personalise it.

Researched answer: Git is a free version control system that tracks changes in computer files. It is mostly used for programmers to work on source code collabortatively on non-linear devolpment. 
Github is a version control system, however it is web based and a great collaboration platform. It can host many types of code and allow people to work on code anywhere.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: ===/== and conditionals? To see if True/False? 

Researched answer:  Comparison operators, logical OR operators, logical AND operators, or bang opereators to even flip that. (Bonus) Or you could also use a boolean function, however that's not an operator.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:Â The index is the count of the individual data piece within the element. The value is what the pice of whole data is or will be returned.

Researched answer: an arrays index is numeric, identifying the element of interest by it's ordinal position in the array (with 1 actually being 0).
a value can be mixed types of data stored in the array. The value is found by using one of .js's built in methods.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: They're similar because they can both be listed and returned in the same way if coded to do so. They can both also contain just strings. However arrays can hold other data types, where as a string can only hold what is it told inside it's quotations which aren't truly different data types.

Researched answer: Arrays are used to group together data of the same type, arrays are accessed by their index, which has an interger value representing it's position in the array. arrays are mutable, which means their values can be altered at any time.
Strings are a data type, representing a sequence of characters that can contain letters, numbers and even symbols. Arrays can be converted to a string and even return the same value ans pass a strict comparisson. However, they differ because they are from different prototypes by using a diferent instance method.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: pair programming is 2 people (a driver and navigator) coding together to work on the same code. They will use psudo code (rubber ducking) to talk through the code out loud as the thought process is going on (to help talk through the process or catch mistakes). They regularly check it in the terminal to see if it works.
A Navigator will think out and talk aloud the thought process. Then direct the driver and dictate what gets typed, word for word, symbol by symbol. The driver is controlling the keyboard and mouse to type into the text editor and terminal, they can also make suggestions and discuss next best steps. After all it is a team effort, they will frequently change positions every 10-25 mins as this can be most effective for productivity.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a collaborative effort that involves 2 people. one at the keyboard (driver) and another communicating (navigator). It uses the 4 eyes principle which helps catch mistakes with 2 people sharing knowledge. There is a consensus between the 2 on what to type, one small piece of code at a time, it is reviewed as they go, pointing out possible errors or
